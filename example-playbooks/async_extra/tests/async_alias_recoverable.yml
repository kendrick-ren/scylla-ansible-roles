# Example playbook.
#
# The playbook demonstrates how to simulate named jobs that can be
# recovered on playbook restart.
#
# The algorithm is as follows:
# 1. Create a job
# 2. Register it's name on a system
# 3. Wait for the job to finish in max 100 tries with 5 secs delay retry.
#    This specific example would fail a wait try if the job is killed or failed to finish.
#    So that if the job is unfinished it will exhaust all trial attempts.
# 4. Delete the job name.
#    Names are soft-link to the job state.
#    If the job name (alias) is deleted than you can start a new one.
#    If you would not delete a job alias its possible to turn it into a singleton.
